### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Information Science PhD student at Drexel University, where I study text via computational methods and computational methods via texts.

# Research Interests

The more abstract ones:

- How words convey meaning
- How technology shapes communication
- How far intention lies from interpretation

The less abstract ones:

- How text can be well-represented as data for computational analysis
- How people write about the things about which they write
- How features of text reflect writer and reach audience

# Education

- Information Science, PhD (~2027); Drexel University
- Analytics, MS (2016); Georgia Institute of Technology
- Chemical Engineering, BS (2015); Drexel University
